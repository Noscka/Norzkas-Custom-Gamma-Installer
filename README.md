The official installer for GAMMA felt badly put together, so I created my own: a customized installer for GAMMA (mod for STALKER anomaly) </br></br>

Improvements over the official Installer:
 - Does everything for you, from installing the Mod Organizer with GAMMA mods to patching the stalker anomaly binaries, so you can just leave the program to run in the background and do its job
 - Install anywhere you want (Might only be possible on Windows 10 and later)
 - Light weight and extremely easy to use
 - Don't have to run as Admin
 - No Confusing GUI
 - No Random Console and extract pop up windows

Requirements:
 - Have unmodded anomaly v1.5.2 already installed and ran at least once
 - Have around 50GB free, final installation will be 30GB with "Remove GAMMA default installer" is set to true, 53GB if set to false

Usage:
 1. Download and unzip the program
 2. Run `NCGI.exe`
 3. Input a path to a valid Stalker Anomaly installation
 4. Input a path to a directory in which you want GAMMA to be installed in
 5. click or press enter on `Start Installation`
 6. Let the installer do all the work (installation can take up 2 hours or longer depending on your internet speed)

Planned Features:
 - Estimated time display
 - Option to install stalker anomaly
