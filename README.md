The official installer for GAMMA felt badly put together, so I created my own: a customized installer for GAMMA (mod for STALKER anomaly) </br></br>

Improvements over the official Installer:
 - Saves 50GBs
 - Not forced to join a discord server
 - Does everything for you, from installing the Mod Organizer with GAMMA mods to patching the stalker anomaly binaries, so you can just leave the program to run in the background and do its job
 - Install anywhere you want (Might only be possible on Windows 10 and later)
 - Light weight and extremely easy to use
 - Don't have to run as Admin
 - No Confusing GUI
 - No Random Console and extract pop up windows
 - Mirror Picking

Requirements:
 - Have unmodded anomaly v1.5.2 already installed and ran at least once
 - Have around 50GB free, final installation will be 30GB with `Save Space` is set to true, 53GB if set to false

Usage:
 1. Download and unzip the program
 2. Run `NCGI.exe`
 3. Input a path to a valid Stalker Anomaly installation
 4. Input a path to a directory in which you want GAMMA to be installed in
 5. click or press enter on `Start Installation`
 6. Let the installer do all the work (installation usually takes 30 minutes or longer depending on your internet speed)

Planned Features:
 - [x] Add File Reuse System
 - [x] Add MultiThreading
 - [ ] Estimated time display
 - [ ] Option to install stalker anomaly
 - [ ] Make Linux Native too
 - [ ] Add Both Single Mod and Mod Pack Updates
