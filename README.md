The official installer for GAMMA isn't the best and needed many improvements, so instead of waiting I created my own: a customized installer for GAMMA (mod for STALKER anomaly) </br></br>

Requirements:
 - Have unmodded anomaly v1.5.2 already installed and ran at least once
 - Have around 50GB free, final installation will be 39GB, or 30GB if "Remove GAMMA default installer" is set to true

Usage:
 1. Download and unzip the program
 2. Run `NorzkasGammaInstaller.exe`
 3. Type in the directory in which you want GAMMA to be installed in
 4. click or press enter on `Start Download`
 5. Let the installer do all the work (installation can take up 2 hours or longer depending on your internet speed)

Features:
 - installs both Mod Organizer with GAMMA mods, so you can just leave the program to run in the background and do its job
 - Install anywhere you want (Might only be possible on Windows 10 and later)
 - Has a nice UI, loading screen and is made to be lightweight

Planned Features:
 - Menu for choosing different settings before install
 - estimated time display

here is the [lastest release](https://github.com/Noscka/Norzkas-Gamma-Installer/releases/latest)
